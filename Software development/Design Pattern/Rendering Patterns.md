![[Pasted image 20230922230713.png]]
##### Better user experience(UX) 
- [[Web Vitals]]

##### Better developer experience(DX)
- **Faster builds times 快速建構** : build fast for quick iteration and deployment  
- **Low server costs 低伺服器成本** : limit and optimize the server execution time to reduce execution costs
- **Dynamic content 動態內容** : be able to load dynamic content performantly 
- **Easy rollbacks 快速還原**: deployment can easily be reverted to a pervious version 
- **Reliable uptime 可被及時訪問: users should always be able to visit the website through operational servers
- **Scalable infrastructure可擴充架構**: easily grow or shrink without running into performance issues

#### 常見模式：
- Static Rendering 靜態渲染：
- SSR (Server-Side Rendering) - rendering a client-side or universal app to HTML on the server.
- CSR (Client-Side Rendering) - rendering an app in a browser, generally using the DOM.
