### Why - the situation to use remote-SSH 
- **Access to Specialized Environment 需要特定環境**
	When you need to access specific development or testing environments that may differ from your local development setup
- **Cross-Platform Development 跨平台開發** 
	If you need to develop and test your application on multiple platforms (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS)
- **Cloud-Based Development 遠端伺服器開發** 
	When you are developing applications that will ultimately run on cloud servers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
- **Resource-Intensive Tasks 需要特定電腦資源**
	When your development tasks require significant computational power or memory
- Avoid local configuration 避免本地配置
	Some development environments require complex configuration and dependency installations, using remote SSH can avoid the need for cumbersome local configuration and installations.
